# Find Fair Vertex by Dijkstra

Data Structures and Algorithms Project

## How to use

Use the following input format to initialize the graph.
```
[Count of vertices] [Count of edges]
[All vertices numbers separated by space]
[First vertex number] [Second vertex number] [Weight of the edge]
...
...
```

Use `test` command to get a traversing way by Depth-first search algorithm.

Use `join` and `left` command followed by an argument of vertex number to add or remove nodes on vertices.

At the end use `exit` command to close the program.
